    Intro About Team Contact Join Level up bit by bit with Learn-a-bit As the
    name says, the purpose of Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit of code at a
    time. In these events, you will build small projects to educate yourself on
    the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These
    events are relaxed and non-competitive, but are still challenging enough to
    push you to use all your resources and knowledge to solve each problem. Join
    a learn-a-ton
